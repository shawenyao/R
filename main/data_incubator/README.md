# European Football Clubs 2019-20 Season Power Rankings

Traditional win-loss-ratio-based performance ranking of soccer clubs is often challenging due to the fact that
* a big win (such as 3:0) against a certain team counts the same as a small win (such as 1:0) against the same team 
* a win against a stronger opponent counts the same as a win against a weaker one 
* not every team has competed against every other team. 

In this project, I applied Colley's method on data scraped from bbc.com, in order to address all three concerns and reveal the true power ranking of the 2019-2020 soccer season.

See the link below for the evolution of such power-ranking among all teams from the biggest 5 football leagues.

## Exploratory Analysis

There is a small but negative correlation between the scores of home and away teams.
