# European Football Clubs 2019-20 Season Power Rankings

Traditional win-loss-ratio-based performance ranking of soccer clubs is often challenging due to the fact that
* at the beginning of the season, every team has a rating of 0/0;
* a win against a stronger opponent counts the same as a win against a weaker one;
* not every team has competed against every other team, even at the end of the season.

In this project, I applied Colley's method on data scraped from bbc.com, in order to address all three concerns and reveal the true power ranking of the 2019-2020 soccer season.

See the link below for the evolution of such power-ranking among all teams from the biggest 5 football leagues.

## Exploratory Analysis
